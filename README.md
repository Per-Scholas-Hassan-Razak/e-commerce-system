 - Models product info using a TypeScript class
 - Calculates discount and tax amounts using utility modules
 - Handles errors using a custom error class and centralized error handler
 - Outputs a clean product summary in the console

## REFLECTION
In this SBA project, I applied my knowledge of TypeScript and advanced JavaScript to build a command-line E-commerce Product Management System. I used object-oriented principles to model product data, utility functions to calculate discounts and tax, and async/await to fetch and display product information. A key challenge was implementing robust error handling using a custom error class and a centralized handler, especially after realizing that fetch() doesnâ€™t throw for HTTP errors by default. I also helped my classmate Lauren troubleshoot parts of her SBA, which reinforced my own understanding. This project strengthened my ability to write clean, maintainable TypeScript code for real-world applications.
